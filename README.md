**redux-blower** is a tiny library that helps you to improve the readability and the performance of your [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) applications.

## How?

Typical [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) application has couple of reducers which are usually functions with big switch statements. When an action is triggered, Redux is going through ALL reducers, ALL switch statements and  ALL `case`s  in order to decide if something should happen. Imagine that you have a Redux application with 100 reducers of average 5 case callbacks. That would mean that for each triggered action up to 500 comparisons has to be made. Additionally reducers will most-likely end up as functions with high complexity and they are not easy to read. Now let me show you what **redux-blower** can do!

```javascript
const actions = [
  'counter:INCREMENT',
  'counter:DECREMENT'
];

const [inc, dec] = actions;

const counterReducer = createReducer({
  initialState: 0,
  listenTo: actions,
  [inc]() {
    return this.state + action.payload;
  },
  [dec](state, action) {
    return state - action.payload;
  }
});

reducer(0, { type: 'counter:INCREMENT', payload: 2 }); // => 2
reducer(5, { type: 'counter:DECREMENT', payload: 5 }); // => 0
```

In the previous example the `counterReducer` will only react to action that belongs to `counter` group. If an action of different type is fired, then only one comparison will be done for `counterReducer`.
